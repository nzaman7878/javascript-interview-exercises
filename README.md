Week 1: Core Foundations
Variables & Data Types: Learn let, const, typeof from MDN; make variables (name, age, isStudent); build an "About Me" app.

Operators & Expressions: Explore arithmetic, comparison, logical operators; calculate BMI; make a calculator.

Strings: Review .length, .toUpperCase(), .slice(); count vowels; create a password strength checker.

Arrays: Use .push(), .pop(), .map(), .filter(); filter even numbers; design a shopping cart.

Functions: Cover declaration, expression, arrow functions; square function; tip calculator.

Objects: Object literals, dot vs bracket access; make a student object; build a library manager.

Revision Project: Student report card with student object, marks array, average calculation.

Week 2: Control Flow + DOM Basics
Conditionals: if-else, switch; check odd/even; grade calculator.

Loops: for, while, for...of; print 1-10; multiplication table generator.

DOM Selectors: querySelector, innerText; change heading text; "Click Me" button.

DOM Events: addEventListener; button changes background color; theme toggle.

DOM Forms: .value, .preventDefault(); capture input; login form with validation.

DOM Manipulation: createElement, appendChild, remove(); add <li>; dynamic To-Do list.

Revision Project: Mini To-Do App (add, delete, complete tasks).

Week 3: Advanced JS + Browser APIs
ES6 Features: Template literals, destructuring, spread; merge arrays; profile card.

Array Higher-Order Functions: map, filter, reduce; total prices; movie filter.

Scope & Hoisting: function vs block scope; var vs let; closure-based counter.

this & Objects: this keyword; object with method; bank account object.

Asynchronous JS – Callbacks: setTimeout, setInterval; timer; digital clock.

Promises: Promise, then, catch; fake API call; weather simulator.

Revision Project: Quiz app (questions, scoring, result).

Week 4: Mastery + Final Projects
Async/Await: async/await; real API fetch (jokes/quotes).

LocalStorage: setItem, getItem; notes app with storage.

Error Handling: try...catch; login form with error alerts.

Classes: class, constructor, extends; User class with methods.

Modules: export, import; modular calculator.

Fetch API: fetch(); GitHub profile fetcher.

JSON & APIs: JSON.parse, JSON.stringify; OMDB movie search.

Capstone Project:

Pick a big project (Weather App, Expense Tracker, Recipe Finder).

Finishing Touches
Push all projects to GitHub.

Write README files for clarity.

Reflect on coding patterns and learning.

Outcome
By following this plan, a developer gains hands-on mastery of JavaScript, confidence with modern web APIs, and a strong GitHub portfolio of 10–15 real projects—a solid base before tackling frameworks like React.

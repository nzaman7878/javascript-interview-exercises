Moving to **Day 6: Objects** from the roadmap!

## Learn

- **Concepts:**
    - **Object literals** store multiple values as properties.

```js
const student = { name: "Amit", age: 25 };
```

    - **Dot vs bracket notation:**
        - Dot: `student.name`
        - Bracket: `student["name"]`
        - Brackets let you use dynamic property names or those with spaces/special chars.
    - Objects can hold any data type—including arrays, other objects, and functions.
- **Reference:** [MDN: Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)


## Apply

- **Exercise:** Create a student object (name, age, grade)

```js
const student = {
  name: "Amit",
  age: 25,
  grade: "A",
};

console.log(student.name);        // Amit
console.log(student["grade"]);    // A
```


## Build

- **Mini-Project:** Library object (add/remove books)

```js
const library = {
  books: [],
  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
  },
  removeBook(book) {
    this.books = this.books.filter(b => b !== book);
  }
};

library.addBook("JavaScript: The Good Parts");
library.addBook("Eloquent JavaScript");
library.removeBook("JavaScript: The Good Parts");

console.log(library.books); // ["Eloquent JavaScript"]
```

Moving to **Day 7: Revision Project** focusing on consolidating Week 1 concepts with a practical project.

## Project: Student Report Card

### Requirements:

- Create a **student object** with details like name, age, and grade.
- Maintain an **array of marks** for various subjects.
- Implement a **function to calculate the average** mark.

***

### Sample Implementation:

```js
const student = {
  name: "Amit",
  age: 25,
  grade: "A",
  marks: [85, 90, 78, 92, 88],

  calculateAverage() {
    let total = this.marks.reduce((sum, mark) => sum + mark, 0);
    return total / this.marks.length;
  }
};

console.log(`Student: ${student.name}`);
console.log(`Average Marks: ${student.calculateAverage()}`);
console.log(`Grade: ${student.grade}`);
```


***

### Focus Areas:

- Use object properties and methods.
- Utilize array methods (`reduce`) for aggregation.
- Reference `this` to access object data inside methods.

***

# day 6 Most interview asked questions with proper explanations and developers thinking, mindset and approaches also explain the code line by line

Here are the **most asked interview questions on JavaScript objects (Day 6 topic)** with explanations, developer mindset, and detailed code walkthroughs to help master concepts deeply.

***

## 1. What is an object in JavaScript?

**Answer:**
An object is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys (properties) are strings (or Symbols), and values can be any data type—including other objects or functions.

**Dev Mindset:**
Think of objects as **real-world entities** with attributes and behaviors, organized for easy access and modularity.

***

## 2. How do you create objects?

**Answer:**

- Object literal:

```js
const obj = { name: "Amit", age: 25 };
```

- Using `new Object()`:

```js
const obj = new Object();
obj.name = "Amit";
```

- Constructor function or ES6 classes for reusable blueprints.

***

## 3. Difference between dot notation and bracket notation?

**Answer:**

- Dot notation: `obj.name` — simpler, clean code, but property name must be a valid identifier.
- Bracket notation: `obj["name"]` — allows dynamic keys and keys with spaces/special chars.

**Example:**

```js
const obj = { "first name": "Amit" };
console.log(obj["first name"]); // Amit
```


***

## 4. How do you add, update, and delete properties?

**Answer:**

```js
const obj = {};
obj.name = "Amit";        // Add/update
obj["age"] = 25;          // Add/update
delete obj.name;          // Delete property
```


***

## 5. How do you loop over object properties?

**Answer:**
Using `for...in` loop or `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`:

```js
const obj = { name: "Amit", age: 25 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
}
```


***

## 6. What is `this` in object methods?

**Answer:**
`this` inside a method refers to the object the method belongs to.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Amit",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Hello, Amit
```


***

## Detailed Code Walkthrough: Library Object Example

```js
const library = {
  books: [],                         // 1. `books` property is an empty array to store book names
  addBook(book) {                   // 2. `addBook` method takes a new book name as param
    this.books.push(book);          // 3. Adds the book to `books` array using `push()` method
  },
  removeBook(book) {                // 4. `removeBook` method filters `books` to exclude specified book
    this.books = this.books.filter(b => b !== book);
  }
};
```

- **Line 1:** Initialize empty list to store books—starting clean is good design.
- **Line 2:** Adds functionality to add books; exposing minimal, clear interface.
- **Line 3:** Uses `this` to access internal state; `push()` changes array in place.
- **Line 4:** Uses `.filter()` to remove a book by creating a new array; preserves immutability outside method.

***

## Developer Thinking \& Approach

- Encapsulate data and related behaviors in objects — **cohesion**.
- Use methods to manipulate internal state, exposing clean APIs.
- Use `this` carefully to manage context inside functions.
- Prefer array methods like `.filter()` for safe and declarative data modification.
- Write reusable, testable, and maintainable code structures.

***

Master these object fundamentals along with thoughtful explanations and coding styles to impress interviews and real-world coding challenges!

# 20 more advanced interview questions and detailed  answers  in object in javascript

Here are **20 advanced JavaScript object interview questions** with detailed explanations, developer thinking, mindset, and practical approaches to answer confidently:

***

### 1. What is an object in JavaScript?

- An object is a collection of key-value pairs. Properties can be any data type including other objects and functions.
- **Mindset:** Think of objects as “real-world entities” with attributes and behaviors.


### 2. How do you create objects?

- Via object literals, constructors (`new Object()`), or ES6 classes.
- **Approach:** Use literals for simplicity; constructors/classes for reusable blueprints.


### 3. Explain dot notation vs bracket notation for property access.

- Dot is straightforward; bracket allows dynamic keys or keys with spaces.
- **Dev Thinking:** Use bracket when key names are variables or have special chars.


### 4. How to add, update, and delete properties dynamically?

- Use `obj.prop = value`, `obj['prop'] = value`, and `delete obj.prop`.
- Be mindful of object mutability.


### 5. What is property enumeration and how to loop over properties?

- With `for...in` loop or `Object.keys()/values()/entries()`.
- Use enumeration carefully, considering inherited vs own properties.


### 6. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

- Shallow copies only copy top-level properties; nested objects are referenced.
- Deep copies duplicate all nested layers (e.g., via recursion or libraries).
- **Approach:** Understand when each is needed to avoid bugs with shared references.


### 7. Explain `this` in object methods.

- `this` references the object calling the method. Arrow functions do not bind their own `this`.


### 8. What are getters and setters?

- Special methods to access or mutate properties with logic control.
- Useful for validation or computed properties.


### 9. What is `Object.freeze()`?

- Makes an object immutable, preventing property value changes or additions.


### 10. Explain prototypes and prototype chains.

- Every object has a prototype (another object). JS uses this chain for inheritance of methods.


### 11. Difference: prototype-based vs classical inheritance?

- JS uses prototype-based inheritance, dynamic and flexible, unlike classical class-based inheritance.


### 12. What is `hasOwnProperty()` and why use it?

- Checks if property belongs directly to the object, not inherited.


### 13. How do you define non-enumerable or read-only properties?

- Use `Object.defineProperty()` with descriptors: `enumerable`, `writable`, `configurable`.


### 14. What are Symbols?

- Unique, immutable property keys useful for avoiding name clashes.


### 15. How does object destructuring work?

- Extracts properties into variables with syntax like

```js
const { name, age } = user;
```


### 16. Explain spread operator with objects.

- Creates shallow clones or merges objects:

```js
const newObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
```


### 17. What is the difference between `Object.assign()` and spread operator?

- Both copy properties but spread is more concise and used in newer JS.


### 18. What are WeakMap and WeakSet, and when to use them?

- Collections with keys that don’t prevent garbage collection; useful for caching or memory-sensitive storage.


### 19. How do you serialize an object to JSON and back?

- Use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`. Understand limitations (no functions, no Symbols).


### 20. How would you implement private properties in JavaScript objects?

- Use closures or ES6 `#private` fields to encapsulate data.

***

**Developer Thinking \& Mindset:**

- Always think about **data encapsulation**, mutability, and appropriate access methods.
- Understand **prototype inheritance** to manage shared behaviors.
- Use modern ES6+ features for **cleaner, safer code**.
- Communicate tradeoffs between shallow/deep copying and immutability.
- Demonstrate awareness of performance and memory management with advanced APIs like WeakMap.

# Give detailed answers with code examples for each object question

Here are detailed answers with code examples for each of the 20 advanced JavaScript object interview questions, along with explanations and developer mindset insights:

***

### 1. What is an object in JavaScript?

**Answer:**
An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings or Symbols and values can be any data type.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Amit",
  age: 25,
  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  }
};
console.log(person.greet()); // Hello, Amit
```

**Mindset:** Objects model real-world entities and organize data logically.

***

### 2. How do you create objects?

**Answer:**

- Object literal (most common):

```js
const obj = { name: "Amit", age: 25 };
```

- Constructor function:

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const p = new Person("Amit", 25);
```

- ES6 class:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
const p = new Person("Amit", 25);
```


**Mindset:** Choose based on reusability and clarity.

***

### 3. Dot notation vs bracket notation?

**Answer:**

- Dot notation:

```js
console.log(obj.name);
```

- Bracket notation (required for dynamic keys or special chars):

```js
const key = "age";
console.log(obj[key]);
console.log(obj["first name"]); // if key has spaces
```


**Mindset:** Use bracket when key names aren’t static or valid identifiers.

***

### 4. Add, update, and delete properties?

```js
obj.city = "Gauhati";       // Add or update
obj["phone number"] = "123"; // Add with space in key
delete obj.age;             // Delete property
```


***

### 5. Loop over properties?

```js
for (let key in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // exclude inherited properties
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
  }
}

Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
});
```


***

### 6. Shallow vs deep copy?

- Shallow copy (copies references):

```js
const copy = { ...obj };
```

- Deep copy example:

```js
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); // limited but simple
```


***

### 7. `this` in methods?

```js
const obj = {
  name: "Amit",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
obj.greet(); // "Amit"
```

`this` refers to the calling object.

***

### 8. Getters and setters?

```js
const obj = {
  firstName: "Amit",
  lastName: "Kumar",
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
  set fullName(name) {
    [this.firstName, this.lastName] = name.split(" ");
  }
};
console.log(obj.fullName);  // Amit Kumar
obj.fullName = "John Doe";
console.log(obj.firstName); // John
```


***

### 9. `Object.freeze()`?

```js
const obj = { name: "Amit" };
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.name = "John"; // fails silently or throws in strict mode
console.log(obj.name); // Amit
```

Freezes object to prevent changes.

***

### 10. Prototype and prototype chain?

```js
function Person() {}
Person.prototype.greet = function() { return "Hello"; };
const p = new Person();
console.log(p.greet()); // Hello
```

Prototypes provide inheritance.

***

### 11. Prototype vs classical inheritance?

JavaScript uses prototype inheritance—objects inherit directly from other objects, not classes. ES6 classes are syntax sugar over prototypes.

***

### 12. `hasOwnProperty()` use?

Check if obj owns a property itself:

```js
obj.hasOwnProperty("name"); // true only for own properties
```


***

### 13. Non-enumerable/read-only properties?

```js
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'id', {
  value: 123,
  writable: false,
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: false
});
```


***

### 14. What are Symbols?

```js
const sym = Symbol('id');
obj[sym] = 123;
console.log(obj[sym]); // 123
```

Unique keys preventing property name conflicts.

***

### 15. Object destructuring?

```js
const { name, age } = obj;
console.log(name, age);
```


***

### 16. Spread operator usage?

```js
const newObj = { ...obj, city: "Gauhati" };
console.log(newObj);
```


***

### 17. `Object.assign()`?

```js
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj, { country: "India" });
```

Copies properties from sources to target.

***

### 18. WeakMap and WeakSet?

Hold weak references to objects, allowing GC;

```js
const wm = new WeakMap();
const keyObj = {};
wm.set(keyObj, "value");
// keyObj can be GC if no other refs exist
```


***

### 19. JSON serialization?

```js
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const parsed = JSON.parse(json);
```

Note: functions/symbols are skipped.

***

### 20. Private properties in JS?

Via closure:

```js
function Person(name) {
  let _name = name;
  this.getName = () => _name;
}
const p = new Person("Amit");
console.log(p.getName()); // Amit
```

Or ES2021 private fields:

```js
class Person {
  #name;
  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
  getName() { return this.#name; }
}
```
